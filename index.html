        S.H.I.E.L.D. is a United States extra-governmental
        military counter-terrorism and intelligence agency,
        tasked with maintaining global security.
        Founded in the wake of the Allied victory over the Axis powers and HYDRA
        in World War II, S.H.I.E.L.D. was organized to protect the United States,
        and later the entire world, from all possible threats.
        With its advanced weapons and extraordinary agents,
        S.H.I.E.L.D. was maybe the greatest military power on Earth.
        Run by Nick Fury and the World Security Council in the modern age,
        S.H.I.E.L.D. had to deal with the significant rise in enhanced individuals,
        dangerous advanced technology, and alien contact. But all the problems S.H.I.E.L.D.
        had to solve eventually led to the formation of the Avengers,
        a response team that was recruited to save the world during the alien
        invasion of Earth in 2012. The agency became publicly known after
        the Battle of New York, partially because of the Rising Tide website.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2014, through the actions of Captain America,
        the world became aware of the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. was
        infiltrated and largely controlled by the terrorist organization HYDRA.
        After the battle in which S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary headquarters, the Triskelion,
        was heavily damaged, all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s classified files were dumped
        on the Internet, and the agency was disavowed by its commanding governments
        and labeled a terrorist organization. Many S.H.I.E.L.D. officials were taken
        into custody and subjected to rigorous questioning. However,
        despite the massive manhunt on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s agents, a few operatives
        scattered across the world in most secret bases remained loyal to their oath,
        saving the most necessary paraphernalia for future use. But the team most
        responsible for the survival of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the team of Agent Phil
        Coulson, who valiantly led his teammates against the forces of HYDRA led
        by the traitors John Garrett and Grant Ward, winning the battle in which
        Garrett's plan ultimately failed. After that battle, Nick Fury appointed
        Phil Coulson the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and tasked him with rebuilding
        the agency from scratch.
